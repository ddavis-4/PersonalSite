# This is my personal website. 
this started as an example of how to host websites using github. It has now evolved to where I keep semi consistent updates of my life while I work on my porfilio cite.

## example
 this is a test example for a wesite hosted on github

### last date of work is Oct 24
    - I did like nothing tbh. 

### We're back after some midterms and it is now Nov 8, lets see what I get done. 
    - I did some stuff with the structure of the site. So initially when I started on this like a year and a half ago I was following a youtube tutorial. my first steps today were getting rid of a lof of the stuff in the header that I didn't understand. From there I made a 'pages' dir and created some pages to navigate to. I really am just makeing a structure I can build from. like on my projects page I have a few links, only the first one leads anywhere right now and it is too my github. 

    TLDR: I made frame work to build from. 


### we are back part 2 Nov 13 
    Things were going stupendous, on Nov 10 Sun, my research partner mikey and I were able to successfully implement a field test of a bluetooth mesh network. I wont go into many details here but it was pretty cool. I am making slow progress with my homlabing project. buttttttt well see what I can get done.
