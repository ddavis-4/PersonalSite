# This is a log of my work on my Project
My most recent updates are at the bottom.

### last date of work is Oct 24
- I did like nothing tbh. 

### We're back after some midterms and it is now Nov 8, lets see what I get done. 
- I did some stuff with the structure of the site. So initially when I started on this like a year and a half ago I was following a youtube tutorial. my first steps today were getting rid of a lof of the stuff in the header that I didn't understand. From there I made a 'pages' dir and created some pages to navigate to. I really am just makeing a structure I can build from. like on my projects page I have a few links, only the first one leads anywhere right now and it is too my github. 

TLDR: I made frame work to build from. 

### we are back part 2 Nov 13 
Things were going stupendous, on Nov 10 Sun, my research partner mikey and I were able to successfully implement a field test of a bluetooth mesh network. I wont go into many details here but it was pretty cool. I am making slow progress with my homlabing project. buttttttt well see what I can get done.

### Dec 6 2024
Hello dearest Mother, 

I am writing to you from the front. The days here grow bleak and dim. I will be sent over the trench in two weeks time.
        
but, I am bored in class and dont wanna focus right now so im going to see what I can get done here for a bit. OH, I did do anything last time.

I have done much Now I must work on uploading my content.

### Dec 9 2024 
I am in my senior design class and we have a quest lecturer. My page is now consistent. I need to work on populating it with content.  

### Dec 11 2024 
I didnt do any work on the site yesterday but I did have a chance in class to upload at lot of the coding assignments ive done for class. I was only able to get the stuff I have on my personal mac, Ill go to a lab computer and upload more content soon. 






# End 2024 - Start 2025
### January 1 2025 
Happy new year. I haven't worked on this in a little while, I finished up school well. My GPA is a little lower than I would like, but still in a good range with one semester left. I do not think I would like to go to graduate school, at least not right off the bat. I want a job I want to get real experience. So, I had been working on my github, linked-in, and resume before christmas. Now I am getting back to it. I just plan to fix the color scheme of my site. 

### January 2 2025 
Well I think I fixed the scheme, and I fixed a few other things. I added functionality so when you scroll down the nav bar will disapear. Now I just need some content for my pages, lol.
I will note that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to work with my code or with the framework I made earlier. imposter syndrome at its finest, I was able to do much of what I wanted with little assistance from AI, which at the end of the day if you wanna get anything done put the AI away eventually. 

- Resume

- Perhaps a write up or two about the projects I am working on so people can read what I write about them.


### January 17 2025 
So it has been a few days about two weeks since I have written to you. I have complete my resume and my indeed profile. I still need to update my Linked in, however I have begun looking for jobs. I am writing this because my resume works on my site now.

okay maybe not.

### January 22 2025

To day was the second day of my last semester. Guess what ? thats right my resume works again on my personal site. please hold the applause, I had help. I had to move it from the 'extra' dir, and put it with the other pages. The only link that doesn't work is on the index page. As it is defined in the js and the route is different from the index page compared to the other pages. So I am going to have to stop bein lazy with my programming but thats an issue for some other time. she'll play!

Also working on my git skills as I am somewhat a bot.

I asked a friend for help and he reminded me how much more talented some programmers are. 


### January 23 2025 

good morning, 

Today I have class... lets go...!
I want to finish this soon I dont think I have much left to do. I will soon start work on my Home Lab project again soon. I am looking forward to having my own remote environment I can ssh into. I am in econ, soon I will populate the rest of this site with my information as I have updated my resume and my linked-in. 

A lot of other sites I have seen are far more advanced, but they are looking to be web designers. This is just a project for me to update to show I know how to code, and catch attention. 

I just remember the other site I have up and how it is broken. Ill get around to fixing it. There is so much to do and so much to learn. 


### January 26 2025 

Sunday funday or whatever, I still need to split up my js file. But in my personal time I have been looking into tailwind css, and typescript. I am looking to see how I can incorporate new languages into my projects.  

I am making a note here to read, the wealth of nations here so I can close the tab.

Also everyone should remember Alan Turing was gay, how about that halting problem. google how he died.

my plan for the js is rather than have a singluar js page for each page I plan to make js pages for the functions I need and call them on the pages as needed. 

Big things to come.

I did it, way easier than I thought. I think I am cooking now. it was touch and go for a second there but the routing will not vanquish me. 

Well after I sectioned out my js file I was messing around with TypeScript. I have never done anything with it, and was interested. I think I change my whole project to TS now ? 

From what I understand it is a way to add types to JS, while also making it a compiled language.



### Feb 4 2025
wow, so much has changed. but so little time as passed. 

Eh, it has been a little bit. I have been away, my last semester of school has begun all too soon. Funny enough, I feel as though my skills are finally beginning to show. Everything is starting to make sense, and my projects are clicking. My switch to TS was so successful I was excited to implement tailwindcss. I worked on it for like a week, with minimal effort after minimal success. With school, work, and my ADHD, my attention has shifted to other projects. 

I discovered aliasing. I needed to install GCC with brew, and alias it to gcc. I caught a sickness, that could only be cured by more customizing of my computer. Two articles on iterm2 later, and 5 big BOOM's(POWERLEVEL10K). I tricked out my terminal, I can say my productivity has gone through the roof now that my environment is personalized. (literallypushed one thing.)
 
I also finally attacked my homelab again, I have a debian server now! What shall I do with it? come back next week, I need to lock in with work, school, and personal stuff. So my projects wont get that much attention I dont think in the coming days. 

It is kinda funny, I accidentally installed `GNOME` on my computer, when I really wanted to install `ssh server`. I plan to just figure out how to disable it, so I can have a desktop enviroment should I ever desire one. It is an old Dell Inspiron. My first objective is to SSH into it. I use SSH every day for school and work. Can I get it to work in my personal life? nope. lol.

Oh for my senior design project my team is going to make a VR game, gameEngine = Gadot 
I schemeing up ideas. I have a lot going on, and coming up. A little overwhelming now that I think about it. what do they say?

```
it is a good kind of busy
```

```
an idle mind is the devils play thing?
```

```
the gates of hell are locked from the inside.
```

```
this too shall pass
```     

oops i didnt mean to get so political. will update the log soon.

I tried it again (implementing tailwind), I know why i am failing. 

- __I have been asking Github copilot for help instead of reading__

Shame on me, or whatever. ill read tmr.

#### 03:06:54 AM
I am back I aliased all my git commands, and this is a test I need to go to sleep after this.
