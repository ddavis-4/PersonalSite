# This is a log of my work on my Project

### last date of work is Oct 24
- I did like nothing tbh. 

### We're back after some midterms and it is now Nov 8, lets see what I get done. 
- I did some stuff with the structure of the site. So initially when I started on this like a year and a half ago I was following a youtube tutorial. my first steps today were getting rid of a lof of the stuff in the header that I didn't understand. From there I made a 'pages' dir and created some pages to navigate to. I really am just makeing a structure I can build from. like on my projects page I have a few links, only the first one leads anywhere right now and it is too my github. 

TLDR: I made frame work to build from. 

### we are back part 2 Nov 13 
Things were going stupendous, on Nov 10 Sun, my research partner mikey and I were able to successfully implement a field test of a bluetooth mesh network. I wont go into many details here but it was pretty cool. I am making slow progress with my homlabing project. buttttttt well see what I can get done.

Hello dearest Mother, 

I am writing to you from the front. The days here grow bleak and dim. I will be sent over the trench in two weeks time.

I have done much Now I must work on uploading my content.

### Dec 11 2024 
I didnt do any work on the site yesterday but I did have a chance in class to upload at lot of the coding assignments ive done for class. I was only able to get the stuff I have on my personal mac, Ill go to a lab computer and upload more content soon. 






# End 2024 - Start 2025
### January 1 2025 
Happy new year. I haven't worked on this in a little while, I finished up school well. My GPA is a little lower than I would like, but still in a good range with one semester left. I do not think I would like to go to graduate school, at least not right off the bat. I want a job I want to get real experience. So, I had been working on my github, linked-in, and resume before christmas. Now I am getting back to it. I just plan to fix the color scheme of my site. 

### January 2 2025 
Well I think I fixed the scheme, and I fixed a few other things. I added functionality so when you scroll down the nav bar will disapear. Now I just need some content for my pages, lol.
I will note that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to work with my code or with the framework I made earlier. imposter syndrome at its finest, I was able to do much of what I wanted with little assistance from AI, which at the end of the day if you wanna get anything done put the AI away eventually. 

- Resume

- Perhaps a write up or two about the projects I am working on so people can read what I write about them.
