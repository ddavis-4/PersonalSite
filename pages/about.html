                    I like this question! I think of my projects in 3 catagories, work, school, and personal. My favorite work project was a Social Engineering study of phishing techniques, and attack methodologies, attempting to discover trends in suseptability patterns.
                    My favorite school project was a VR game called "escape at the museum", where I worked on a team of five to make an escape game. I enjoyed making goxel models, programming in godot script, and working with a team to create a fun interactive story.
                    My favorite personal project is my homelab! I have been working on it for a while now and my progress is a little slow, but I love applying all the concepts I learned in College.
